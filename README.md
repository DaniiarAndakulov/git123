Hello Teftelka

Тут мы сразу можем видеть текст на заходя в файл!

If i type here something more, do i will have an updated data on my computer as well?

It works from computer to the cloud. But will it work vice versa?

I will try to type here something from my mac and lets see what will show on github cloud

I tried to authorize my Mac VS  and lets try now

Good it worked. The information i entered from mac showed on computer. My next thing would be to pull down this message from hub to my mac

The message didnt show up on my mac. Will try to update once more. Maybe i missed something like "Saving"

## Save icon

The above message synced with my mac but I just clicked wrong button and i lost the message again. WHat is important is to edit readme file in commit down below
